This version of pam_chroot was originally written by Matthew Kirkwood
(weejock@ferret.lmh.ox.ac.uk) and then heavily modified by Ed
Schmollinger (schmolli@frozencrow.org).  Bugs are likely attributable
to schmolli, and that is who you should send bug reports to.

The following have contributed non-trivial code and/or ideas:

Heiko Hund <heiko@ist.eigentlich.net>
  - fix memory leaks, expanded user/group regex support

John Newbigin <jn@it.swin.edu.au>
  - security checks for conf file & chroot directories
